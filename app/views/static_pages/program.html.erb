<h2><p>Dresscode:</p></h2>

<p>One of the big questions for every guest at a wedding is what the dresscode is.  Unfortunately, not everyone can have it as easy as the bride! </p>

<p>As you can see from the program above, there will be a break between the reception after the church and the evening ceremonies. In Germany, this break is sometimes used by guests to change outfits. Women often wear a short/cocktail dress to the church ceremony and then change into a long dress for the evening festivities.  Similarly, men might start in a suit and then change into a tuxedo. </p>

<p>If you want to do that, that's great, but if you don't feel like it, that's also absolutely fine. You would simply follow our approach of not changing!</p>

<p>There is no specific dresscode for Friday night or Sunday morning. What do they call it these days? Smart casual will work just fine.</p>
